*Technical Writing Final Project*

![CDF Logo](/images/cdf-logo.png)

This semester, I was lucky enough to take a Technical Writing Course (ENGL360 at UTK) that was based around the *Battlestar Galactica* television show.

I had never seen the show before, but had been wanting to get started, so this class was perfect! It was also a great way to learn how to improve my technical writing skills in a fun way.

For our final project, my group developed the *Cylon Defense Force Manual*, which is a work by a conspiracy-theorist group within the BSG universe. The CDF believed that the Cylons would return while everyone else in the Colonies had already moved on. They made this manual to prepare for the coming invasion.

We decided to publish the work in a website format. I built and designed the website, which [you can view here](http://spencerhowell.github.io/resources/cdf-manual). The website is built in pure HTML and CSS, and designed to look like unofficial government documents and conspiracy theory pamphlets. The goal was to make it easy to reproduce and display on any type of computer or in print (which the CDF would need when the Cylons attacked!).

I hope you have as much fun reading it as we did writing it! Special thanks to my team members: Aaron Vincent, Carter Bowman, and Raphael Jones. Also, thank you to Dr. Anne Snellen for a great class! I'd definitely recommend taking it if you're at UTK!
