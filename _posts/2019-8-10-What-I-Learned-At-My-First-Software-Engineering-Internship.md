title: What I Learned at my First Software Engineering Internship
---
*An introduction to the industry*

For twelve weeks over this past summer of 2019, I have been working at Garmin, Inc. as a Software Engineer Intern.

I worked with the team that developed the [Vivofit Jr. mobile app](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/568169) for both Android and iOS platforms. I was able to perform as an additional member of the team, taking tickets and submitting code that would be implemented alongside the rest of the team.

Being my first software engineering internship, there was a lot to learn during my time with the team, and they were incredibly supportive throughout. Here are my biggest takeaways from the summer:

### 1. The Agile development process

### 2. Surviving code review

### 3. Mobile development best practices

### Bonus: Kansas City Fun!
