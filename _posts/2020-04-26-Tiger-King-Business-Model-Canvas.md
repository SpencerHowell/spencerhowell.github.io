title: Tiger King Business Model Canavs
---
*Joe Exotic, Entrepreneur*

In the past year of my Entrepreneurship classes, I have been learning about the Business Model Canvas. The Business Model Canvas is a framework for understanding how a business venture creates, delivers, and recaptures value. 

The framework was originally devised by authors Alexander Osterwalder and and Yves Pigneur in their *[Business Model Generation](https://www.amazon.com/Business-Model-Generation-Visionaries-Challengers-ebook/dp/B06X426D4F/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=business+model+canvas&qid=1587942801&sr=8-1)* book. Having no formal background in business, this book provided me with an intuitive and entertaining explanation of how a business model is created and analyzed.

For extra credit for an exam in my New Venture Planning course, we were tasked with applying what we have learned to a fiction or nonfiction work. I chose to build a business model canvas for perhaps the world's best known entrepreneur right now: Joe Exotic.

Here is my analysis of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park, as operated by Joe Exotic:

I've really enjoyed building my understanding of business and how they operate. Understanding the whole picture of a business's operations is incredibly helpful not only as an entrepreneur, but also as an employee and an individual.

I've already begun applying the concepts in Osterwalder's books to student organizations that I am a part of; I've also started building a personal Canvas for my professional goals.
