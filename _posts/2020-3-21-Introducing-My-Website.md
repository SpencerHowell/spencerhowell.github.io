*Thanks for visiting!*

Hello, and welcome to my website!

I hope to use this space to blog about software development, student life, and entrepreneurship. I would also like to show off some of my side projects here as well. 

To kick off the site, I have uploaded some articles that are written in retrospect of experiences I have had during my undergraduate career. The dates on the posts indicate when the experience took place, not necessarily when the final article was published. 

I used the excellent [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to quickly create this site. This generates a fast static site and allows me to write blog posts in Markdown, which I find really enjoyable. This process has also allowed me to broaden my knowledge of web development. I would highly recommend this if you're looking to create your own blog!

Stay tuned for more posts!
