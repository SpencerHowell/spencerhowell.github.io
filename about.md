I strive to create intuitive, efficient software that makes daily life easier for users.
        
Specifically interested in Android and iOS mobile apps, I unite an understanding of software development, design, and user experience to create applications that are natural to use.

I believe an entrepreneurial spirit can be applied to any project. I use my understanding of business to create value for customers.
