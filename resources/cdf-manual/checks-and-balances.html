        <h2>Checks and Balances System</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>In order to avoid conflict, the President of the CDF will remain in charge of all operations. The remaining members of the cabinet, military and government shall provide information and support when necessary.</li>
            <li>The President of the CDF, along with the Head of Military shall oversee all cases, along with the Judiciary Committee with the exception of military cases. All cases must come through the Judiciary Committee and will be handled as followed.</li>
            <li>Presidential Pardon: As trials come to a close, as is the case in any system, some punishments may be deemed unfair and could be very costly. In order to prevent such acts, The President of the CDF will allow pardon under these conditions:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In times of war any civilian or military personnel shall be pardoned</li>
                <li>Once pardoned, they will be monitored using CDF tech and kept in one squadron.</li>
                <li>Once the war is over, based upon their actions and service the final decision will be made by the president to either pardon them permanently, or send them back.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Should the Judiciary Committee choose to uphold one of these pardons in any scenario apart from war, they will be eligible to vote on a decision amongst themselves.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If the votes end up even, the CIO will have the final verdict.</li>
            </ul>
