        <h2>CDF Manifesto</h2>

        <p>The CDF strives to oversee the protection of humanity’s colonies from the imminent Cylon attack. A Cylon sighting has not occurred in over forty years, therefore most of humanity’s leadership has grown complacent. With outdated protocols, lack of leadership, and unprotected technology, we stand by waiting to be annihilated.</p>
        <p>The CDF counters these lackluster government and military protocol by remaining vigilant against the imminent Cylon attack. We are here to offer reliable protection to the civilians of the twelve colonies, a service the government fails to provide. After the first war, the government liquidated military spending in favor of colonial expansion, even going to the point of decommissioning one of the most notorious Cylon killers, the Battlestar Galactica.</p>
        <p>The CDF, on the other hand, has the foresight to remain vigilant to the inevitable future Cylon attack. Although ridiculed by the masses, we stand by in the shadows preparing for the day when we are called to service. This is why we have prepared this manual knowing the government refuses to inform its citizens of the true danger that faces them.</p>
        <p>The CDF uses experience and knowledge from the first Cylon War to prepare to defend the colonies on soil, water, and in vacuum. Although you may be unprepared, the CDF hopes this manual will provide some of the information necessary to ensure humanity’s survival as we protect from all fronts.</p>
