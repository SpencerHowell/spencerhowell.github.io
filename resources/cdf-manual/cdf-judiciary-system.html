        <h2>CDF Judiciary System</h2>

        <p>In the event of a Cylon attack on the Colonies, communities could be isolated from the rest of humanity for extended periods of time. We understand that order through law must be established in order to have a functioning community.</p>
        <p>Assigning this authority to one person could cause a shift in the balance of power and allow corruption to take place. The CDF has ordered that a judiciary group will be set in place and the leaders of this group will be from outside colonial personnel, otherwise members of the CDF will lead. This will allow for an impartial and fair judicial system to be established. For a full list of laws and articles endorsed by the CDF, refer to your local CDF outpost. Each contains a copy of the CDF Bylaws.</p>
        <p>The goal is simple: give everyone a fair chance while maintaining order in a system that is unbiased and balanced. It is necessary to hear both sides of the argument to prevent any rash and costly decisions. In order to maintain a fair system, the following will be how the CDF Judiciary Committee will function:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The chief investigative officer (CIO) will be a member of the CDF and have leadership over all judiciary matters for a case. The CIO governs what occurs during all levels of investigative work.</li>
            <li>The other five board members will be from civilian, military, and CDF origin. Each will be tasked with particular investigations from the CIO and be in charge of a group of IIâ€™s. They will collect individual information and build a case for any particular investigation.</li>
            <li>Initial investigators (II) will be the detectives who go out and seek information for the investigation.</li>
            <li>Judiciary jurors (JJ) will be selected for any particular case. They can be both civilian and military and serve as the decisive factor in innocence or guilt.</li>
        </ul>
