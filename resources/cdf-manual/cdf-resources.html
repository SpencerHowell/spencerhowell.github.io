        <h2>CDF Resources</h2>

        <p>As a member of the Cylon Defense Force, you have access to the wide network of resources and personnel that make up our organization. Our meticulous planning will allow us to emerge from the impending Cylon attack as survivors. We will be the best prepared, the most equipped, and the most resilient. We will be the leaders of the resistance.</p>
        <p>Therefore, it is important that every member of the CDF knows what resources are available and how they will be utilized during and after the attack. Familiarize yourself with this list, and more details about how each item will be used in the response to the attack will be found throughout the manual.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Safehouses</strong> - The CDF has a network of bunkers across all twelve colonies. These bunkers are designed to withstand nuclear and radiological weapons, and they are equipped with a minimum of 300 days worth of rations, water, and oxygen. A variety of weaponry is stored in each for defense from Cylon soldiers or other humans, if necessary.</p>
        <p>You will be informed of the CDF safehouses closest to your primary residence. Further, the secure CDF radio frequency can be used to request the location of the nearest safehouse should you find yourself in an unfamiliar place during or after the attacks.</p>
        <p>Each safehouse should contain at least a standard CDF stockpile based on the population of the surrounding community.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>CDF Fleet</strong> - The CDF has been purchasing and outfitting a fleet of spacecraft designed for combat and long-term travel. This fleet will allow the CDF to navigate to safety when the attack happens. Further, it will allow us to combat the Cylons in the air as well as on the ground.</p>
        <p>As a member of CDF, you might be responsible for maintaining one or more of these crafts. It is vital that your craft remains in an operational and prepared state at all times. When the attack happens, time will be of the essence.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Training</strong> - All members of the CDF have access to the variety of training materials and courses provided. Weapons training, self-defense courses, attack drills, medical certification, and more will be coordinated by your local CDF Chapter’s leadership.</p>
        <p>As a new member, you will have already completed your inaugural training and exam. However, it is vital that you continue to renew your certifications on a continual basis. Follow the schedule that you have been provided by your local chapter’s leadership.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Network</strong> - As a member of CDF, you will be meeting regularly with your local chapter, as well as semi-annual meetings with Colonial leadership. This is the most valuable resource the CDF has. The only way we will survive the return of the Cylons is together. Therefore, build your camaraderie with your fellow members. When the attack happens, they will be the only people that you can count on.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>CDF Bylaws</strong> - The CDF was established to protect humanity from the threat of another Cylon invasion. The founders of the CDF recognized that there was a possibility for the necessity of self-governing a community. In light of this possibility, the founders established a fair and just set of Bylaws to govern a population for an extended period of time.</p>
